# El-Farol-and-traffic
The "El Farol Bar Problem" python notebook in this repository consists of all of the simulations that I wrote for my blog post on applying the El Farol Bar problem to the problem of traffic in the real world. In addition, the notebook includes further information about the simulations and detailed mathematical arguments that I thought would clutter up the blog post, so in this sense the notebook also represents a sort of Appendix to my post. [The blog post can be found here.](https://www.jaredpopowski.com/complexity/2020/8/30/the-el-farol-bar-problem-an-introduction-to-complexity) 

You can click the launch binder badge below to open the notebook in an executable environment and mess around with the simulations right away!
